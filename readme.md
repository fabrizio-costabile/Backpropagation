# Backpropagation
Implementation of the Backpropagation algorithm to train Feedforward Neural Networks.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project implements the algorithm defined by the pseudocode found in "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third Edition)" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (on page 734, Chapter 18).
<br>

### Built With

* Java
* JUnit
* Maven

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

UML class diagram of this project (except the unit test), located in the **/docs** folder.

![Backpropagation - UML Class Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabrizio-costabile/Backpropagation/main/docs/uml-class-diagram.png) 

### Prerequisites

An IDE to import Java (Maven) projects and run JUnit tests.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Download the source code and run the **SinusoidPredictionTest.java** JUnit test.
The unit test will validate the implementation of the algorithm. 
<br>
<br>
Example of usage:
```
Backpropagation backpropagation = new Backpropagation(SIZES_OF_LAYERS, new SigmoidFunction());
backpropagation.learn(dataSet, 1, 0);
double[] predictions = backpropagation.predict(inputs);
```
A comprehensive usage can be found in the **SinusoidPredictionTest.java** JUnit test.
