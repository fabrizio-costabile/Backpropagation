# Backpropagation
Implementation of the Backpropagation algorithm to train Feedforward Neural Networks.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project implements the Backpropagation algorithm defined in pseudocode in "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third Edition)", by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, on page 734 (Chapter 18).
<br>

### Built With

* Java
* JUnit
* Maven

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

UML class diagram (located in **/docs** folder) showing the use of a **Template Pattern**.

### Prerequisites

An IDE to import Java (Maven) projects and run JUnit tests.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A comprehensive usage can be found in the <code>SinusoidPredictionTest</code> JUnit test, 
that validates the algorithm's implementation by generating a "very good" **Mean Absolute Percentage Error** (MAPE < 1%).

###Example of usage:
```
Backpropagation backpropagation = new Backpropagation(SIZES_OF_LAYERS, new SigmoidFunction());
backpropagation.learn(dataSet, 1, 0);
double[] predictions = backpropagation.predict(inputs);
```

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
